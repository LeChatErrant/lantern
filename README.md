# Lantern

Backend development can be **hard**, **long**, and **dark**. Even more to produce **modern**, **robust**, **production-ready** APIs

Say hello to **Lantern**, your guide through the *****backend abyss*****

> Lantern is currently under heavy development, so new features will be release soon ❤️
>
> Don't hesitate to share your improvements or to give feedback on Discord **(LeChatErrant#6074)** :wink:

# What is it ?

**Lantern** is an **opinionated** CLI to assist backend development

It aims to make backend development **fast** and **easy**, and focuses on generating **maintainable code**

___

A **lantern** project follows a lot of **good practices** while staying entirely **modifiable** by developers

In summary, it simply gives you a **guideline** by writing **boilerplate code**

> An example lantern project, serving as guidelines reference, can be found at **[API-template](https://github.com/LeChatErrant/API-template)**
