Backend development can be **hard**, **long**, and **dark**. Even more to produce **modern**, **robust**, **production-ready** APIs

Say hello to **[Lantern](https://github.com/LeChatErrant/lantern)**, your guide through the *****backend abyss*****

> Lantern is currently under heavy development, so new features will be release soon ❤️

> Don't hesitate to share your improvements or to give feedback on Discord **(LeChatErrant#6074)** :wink:

# What is it ?

**[Lantern](https://github.com/LeChatErrant/lantern)** is an **opinionated** CLI to assist backend development

It aims to make backend development **fast** and **easy**, and focuses on generating **maintainable code**

| ![Demo](https://github.com/LeChatErrant/lantern/blob/master/.github/assets/generate.gif) |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| V1 demo, will be updated soon ! And trust me, V2 is nothing like V1 ❤️                   |

A **lantern** project follows a lot of **good practices** while staying entirely **modifiable** by developers

In summary, it simply gives you a **guideline** by writing **boilerplate code**
